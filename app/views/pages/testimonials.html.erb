                When TOCA offered assistance to me during a very rough period in my life, I not only had the peace of mind that I was going to be ok and would get past this, but it also gave me the comfort of knowing that TOCA had my back; they were there to pick me up and help me move forward. I am blessed to work for a company that feels like a second family to me.

                  I always thought charity was something rich, older people did with their extra money and time. It wasnâ€™t until I started to volunteer and get involved with helping others, did I understand the value and how good it made me feel to support my community.

                  Until I started working with the Special Olympics, I didn't understand the value for me and my community of charitable work.
